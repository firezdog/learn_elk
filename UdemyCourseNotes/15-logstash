This lecture -- how to download and set up logstash
Logstash: data processing pipeline engine, ingest data from many sources
Stages of pipeline
    Data sources => inputs (I) => filters (II) => outputs (III) => Data destinations (e.g. ElasticSearch)
    configured using jruby, json like language
installing on linux with apt-get -- https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/7.10/installing-logstash.html#_apt
    wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -
    sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https
    echo "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/7.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-7.x.list
    etc. (see website)
specifying a test config
    ./logstash/bin/logstash -e 'input { stdin {}} output { stdout {}}' -- test whether logstash works
        whatever we type will be sent back to us (tests that logstash is working, uses stdin and stdout)
        logs will be saved in our logstash directory
    (digression) unrecognized VM option occurs if the java version is incompatible, we need 8
        find where java is installed
        it may have both jdk 10 and jdk 8
        we need path to point to 8 as well
        change path in .bashprofile (or .bashrc or whatever) using vi or nano
            export JAVA_HOME=<path to version 8>
