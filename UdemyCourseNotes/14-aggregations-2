more aggs (continuation from previous lecture)
how to get all of the statistics?
    consolidation with "stats"
    buckets and metrics
        buckets group fields together (by token / value?)
            by make or say by date sold
            define a range bucket {range: {field, ranges}}
                ranges use "from" and "to" with date YYYY-MM-DD
                response
                    we get the range of dates and the number of docs
                what is the average price of the vehicles sold during the different date ranges
                    nested aggs
    remember that nested aggs go under the name of the aggs under which they are nested
        nested metrics fall under the scope of the metric within which that are nested
        metric? -- is that what organizes the buckets?
aggregation scoping -- limiting aggregations to a specific query
