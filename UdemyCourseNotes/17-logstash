confirm we got 300,000 docs via logstash into ES
in the example, there are 31 indices -- we in fact seem to have only one index?
    probably a version difference?
we can use ES endpoint: localhost:9200/logstash-*/_count
you can close out of logstash at any time
kibana: management => index_management (now under data => index management)
we can click on an index and see the mapping
logtstash deduced a great deal of information that was inferred
tabs
    discover: helps to explore the data -- query, filter, inspect document structure
    visualize: build visualizations (bar charts etc.)
we need to specify the index pattern, e.g. logstash-* then pick @timestamp, create index pattern
we can now see all the fields in the index
no data displays in discover because it is from way back -- we can update to say 2013 and then the familiar view (early days of Zoro) appears
    choose e.g. 2014 May to 2014 June
specifies what the log looks like on a particular day (the actual data that goes to the fields) -- each entry is a doc
we can pick what fields we want and look at analytics for the various fields
all the extra information came from logstash filters (geoip)
creating a visualization is now possible
easy example: data table
we can now select aggregations
    say terms aggregating over cities (under split rows)
    we see how many came from each city
pie chart
    spite slices on terms on field city_name
we can also present the data on a dashboard
save visualization e.g. pie_chart_cities
now we can create a dashboard and add it to the dashboard
logstash indexes the documents, then after choosing a pattern we can filter and visualize the data
