Adding a doc to our index with one extra field -- what happens?
    new field / type is inferred / structure is modified (mapping)
We would like production to be strict and reject updates to the mapping
    specified during index creation or after
    "dynamic" -- false / strict
        false: unmapped data will be ignored
        strict: unmapped data will throw an error (good for logging)
    PUT customers/_mapping/_doc { "dynamic": false } -- mistake in lecture, you have to use PUT
        "dynamic" will show up at the top level under "mappings"
        this does allow you to put in an empty document, though
testing analyzers
    see es documentation: analyzers -- https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-analyzers.html
    POST _analyze { "analyzer": <analyzer>, "text": <text to test> }
    result will give you a list of the analyzed tokens
    some analyzers
        whitespace -- splits on whitespace
            the whitespace analyzer includes the period as part of the token (includes punctuation)
        standard -- splits on whitespace and lowercases, removes punctuation
        simple -- splits on non-letters, e.g. "fox374!;" => "fox" -- splitting on non-letters
        english -- removes punctuation, ignores "the" (stop word), analyzes down to roots (some conjugations, plural vs singular)
            there are other languages as well (semantics of different languages)
    custom analyzer can also be defined
        e.g. in docs std_folded
        defined in "settings"
        can filter things like asciifolding
        you can test custom analyzers on the index in which they are defined via GET <index>/_analyze
        analyzer will be applied both on indexing and searching
