What happens we send an ES request?
ES is distributed -- laptops on the same network can both run ES instances (cluster)
    Why cluster? -- if we distribute ES to different nodes, problems (search) will be solved more quickly
    parallelism
Index
    e.g. vehicles, business
    number_of_shards / number_of_replicas indicate underlying structure of index
    suppose an index with some documents (vehicles / 100) -- this is the logical representation
    physical reprsentation = shards, where the index is split into shards
        some of the docs would be on one shards, some on the other 
            (and they might also overlap and have consistency?)
        why shards? a shard allows an index to split between nodes
        replica shards contain backups of data in a given shard
        So we might have a node 1 with P1 and R0, node 2 with P0 and R1
        nodes have backups of each other's primary data
        replication prevents data loss
            one machine running one instance would be one node -- if it goes down we lose the data
            replication allows for higher availability (if primary node goes down, we can get the data from somewhere else)
    so for a cluster, we have many nodes through which the data is distributed
        any node in the cluster can serve the request
        every node knows where to find a given piece of information
